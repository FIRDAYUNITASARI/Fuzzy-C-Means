# Fuzzy-C-Means
Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) is a fuzzy theory-based clustering method that allows one data to be a member of more than one cluster with a certain degree of membership. The algorithm works by minimizing an objective function to group data based on proximity to the cluster center, which is updated iteratively until it converges.
